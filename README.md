# Intern Management System

Welcome to the Intern Management System GitHub repository! This web application is designed to facilitate efficient communication and management between three main parties: Admins (lecturers overseeing internships), Companies (offering internships), and Students (seeking internships). Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this system aims to streamline the intern management process for universities.

## Features

### Admins
- Monitor companies offering internships
- Establish communication with companies and students
- Generate various reports (e.g., single student details, company details)
- Manage student and company registrations within the system

### Companies
- Post internship opportunities
- Interact with registered students and administer the selection process

### Students
- Upload CVs
- Apply to listed internships through the system

## Future Updates
We have exciting plans for future updates to enhance the Intern Management System. Some upcoming features include:
- Bulk insertion for efficient data management
- Media hosting capabilities
- And many more!
